############## Strings ###############

# Python can do all sorts of useful things with strings. 
# It is actually a great language for handling text 

#####################################

# You can use + to concatenate two strings

firstname = "Jane"
lastname  = "Doe"
fullname  = firstname + " " + lastname

## Two different ways of printing strings
print('(1) Full name is: ' + fullname)
#print('(2) Full name is: %s' %fullname)


## You can also use += to append more text to a string
#fullname  = "John"
#fullname += " "
#fullname += "Doe"

#print('(3) Full name is: '+fullname)

#print('"%s" is %s characters long'%(fullname, len(fullname)))
